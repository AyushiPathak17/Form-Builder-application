For Running this application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your application.

Start by setting up the Backend server and Database by the following commands-
1- node server.js, this will start the Backend server.
2- run mongod in one terminal, keep it running. Open another terminal and run mongosh. This will start the database setup.
3- Now our backend and database are started, we will start our frontend.

Start the frontend by the following command-
1- In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run npm start.
2- This will start the frontend and you can see the application running.

Thanks
